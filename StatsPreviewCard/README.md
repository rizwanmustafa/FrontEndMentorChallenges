## My process

Firstly I designed the desktop layout using CSS flexbox. Then I tweaked the website to be responsive even for a mobile device

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I am going to focus more on website responsiveness as I seem to be lacking behind in that
