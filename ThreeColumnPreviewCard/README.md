## My process

First of all I saw the design and Flexbox for solving this problem. While looking at the design, I saw where flexbox was required and marked it. Then I created the basic layout and design for desktop for the webpage. Then I added paddings and other minor things needed to achieve the look. Lastly, I tweaked the design to fit the mobile design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to use CSS custom properties.
